<h1>Miriam's Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>LOTR: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>This movie, all 3 movies in fact, fill me with such hope.</p>
<h3>Return to Me</h3>
<p>This is one of the best romance movies I've ever seen, and it's just a good, clean movie.</p>
<h3>Happy Gilmore</h3>
<p>This one is classic Adam Sandler, and Chris and I still laugh out loud thinking about certain parts.</p>
