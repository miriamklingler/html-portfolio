<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a short person in her mid-30's who has been married for 15 years to a wonderful man named Chris. I love cats and reading. I also love watching  Asian dramas and listening to Kpop.</p>

<p>I am working right now as an admin/receptionist at a real estate company, and I love my job and the people I work with. I have been an assistant of some kind in real estate for almost 9 years now. I am learning web development on the side to see if it's something I'm really interested in pursuing.</p>
